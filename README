---INTRODUCTION------------------------
The Penn Hillel App was built for the purpose of consolidating much of the Hillel website into an 
easy to use application. Students can do a range of things from signing up for Shabbat dinners, to 
finding out which community events are coming up, to learning about some of the different groups 
within Penn Hillel.

---APPLICATION ARCHITECTURE------------
The application opens to the main menu page. The main menu consists of a table of icons for users to 
pick from. Below are the icons that appear:

	ORGANIZATIONS: 
	EVENTS: Lists out the different events available for the day chronologically. Clicking on an 
	event will open up a page with more details.
	FOOD: Lists out the dining options for the day. Will which menu is displayed depending on 
	the time of day. May sign up for Shabbat dinners from here
	SIGN UP: Takes events registered through a website we built and loads them so students may 
        sign up to attend them.
	STORE: Links to the Hillel web store.
	GALLERY: Links to the Hillel Facebook gallery.
	ABOUT: Describes Hillel and lists out the faculty and staff.
	SETTINGS: Change notification settings per organizations or group.

Data is stored on Parse, a free cloud based mobile app back end that allowed us to easily integrate the back end into our Java code using their API.
